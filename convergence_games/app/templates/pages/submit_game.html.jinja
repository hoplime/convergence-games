                    <p>
                        If your game is accepted you'll be eligible for free tickets to Convergence, and goody bags if
                        you run 3 or more sessions, so don't buy a ticket just yet - look out for an email.

                        From years past, we've gained some idea of what we think makes a good game submission that will
                        get players excited to come to your table, and give them a clear idea of what they're in for by
                        rating your game highly in their preferences. Please read below for some of our suggestions.

                                With our new game selection system coupled with a robust feedback system, Convergence
                                2024 was the year of data analytics. We took feedback from GMs, players and expert
                                writers to give YOU the best shot at running a spectacular game at Convergence 2025
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are 3 main reasons players choose a game: GM reputation; it's something
                                new/unfamiliar; it has a killer pitch! If you are going to the effort of running a game,
                                you want players who are keen, committed, and excited to be at your table.

                                Here are some suggestions for picking both a game system and an adventure. They are just
                                suggestions, however, so if you have an idea for something that doesn't meet these
                                criteria that you're excited to run, feel free to submit it. Players don't want to play
                                a game with a reluctant GM. Pitch and run a game <b>YOU</b> are enthusiastic about.

                                    but the people have spoken: D&D unfortunately falls behind in popularity.
                                    Convergence attendees tend to gravitate towards fresh and unique systems and games,
                                    rather than the classics. If you do want to run some D&D, try and come up with an
                                    original idea for your adventure rather than a standard dungeon crawl.

                                    Reich, Triangle Agency, and Mythic Basionland, is more likely to draw players over
                                    long standing classics like Monster of the Week, and Blades in the Dark. Players
                                    only get to play a finite number of games at Convergence, and given the option, they
                                    gravitate towards new, interesting and rare games.

                                    <b>Light over Dark</b> — In something of a paradox, GMs at Convergence often want to
                                    run darker games. Run what YOU want, but keep in mind that players tend towards more
                                    family friendly themes.You also have no control over who you'll get at your table
                                    which means darker games may need a lot of on the fly adaptation if they won't suit
                                    your players.

                                    it is best to bolster your credentials. For some players there can be the lingering
                                    fear this is a design test of something thrown together last week. To avoid this,
                                    mention how long the RPG has been in development, how many other events you have run
                                    it at, and if you've created other RPGs.

                                    your own adventure be cautious about investigation mysteries, especially social
                                    investigation mysteries - these have a strong tendency to 'overrun' if the players
                                    go down the wrong rabbit hole, which is fine for a regular gaming group but a
                                    different convention experience. You can deploy some tricks, but if you want to run
                                    a mystery, we strongly suggest you playtest it beforehand, and adjust as needed.
