                In addition to praise and adoration, there's a host of free tickets and goodie bag items to get for

            <h2 class="mt-4 text-xl">Keen to Volunteer?</h2>
            <p>
                Convergence 2025 has a lot of moving parts and we need volunteers to help make sure that the convention
                runs as smoothly as possible. We need volunteers to help attendees with using the game selection app,
                keep an eye on the games being run and man the front desk.
            </p>
            <p>
                In return for this we'll either give you a goodie bag or free entry to one day of the con (your choice).
                Our goal is that each volunteer will be working for one game session and one break leaving you the rest
                of the time to enjoy yourself!

            <p>
                Convergence is a 2 day games convention, organised by The Waikato Role-Playing Guild. The aim is to give
                new and experienced players a chance to meet like minded people, make new friends, try new games and
                have a blast doing so. At Convergence there will be games running, seminars, socialising, and vendors
                providing a range of gaming related equipment. The games will run in 3 and 4 hour slots, depending on
                the game itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the games will be run as “one-shots” meaning it will be a self-contained adventure within the time
                slot. There will be games for newbies and experienced players alike. Pre-generated characters will be
                provided where needed. We'll make sure you have everything you need to hit the ground running and have a
                fantastic weekend!
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots more details and information will be available as we get closer to the event, so keep an eye on
                this site and our social media.
