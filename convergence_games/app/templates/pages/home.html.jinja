            <p>
                Convergence is a 2 day games convention, organised by The Waikato Role-Playing Guild. The aim is to give
                new and experienced players a chance to meet like minded people, make new friends, try new games and
                have a blast doing so. At Convergence there will be games running, seminars, socialising, and vendors
                providing a range of gaming related equipment. The games will run in 3 and 4 hour slots, depending on
                the game itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the games will be run as “one-shots” meaning it will be a self-contained adventure within the time
                slot. There will be games for newbies and experienced players alike. Pre-generated characters will be
                provided where needed. We'll make sure you have everything you need to hit the ground running and have a
                fantastic weekend!
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots more details and information will be available as we get closer to the event, so keep an eye on
                this site and our social media.
